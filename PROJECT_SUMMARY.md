3. `get_user_bookings` - List user's events
4. `cancel_booking` - Cancel events
5. `reschedule_booking` - Reschedule events
6. `get_event_types` - Get available event types

### Cal.com API Integration
- REST API v2 integration
- Bearer token authentication
- Comprehensive error handling
- Support for all major booking operations

### Web Interface Features
- **Real-time Chat**: Instant message sending/receiving
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Quick Actions**: Pre-defined buttons for common tasks
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful gradient design with animations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages

## 🧪 Testing

### API Testing
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Test chat endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "help me to book a meeting"}'
```

### Cal.com Integration Testing
```bash
python3 test_cal_api.py
```

## 💬 Usage Examples

### Booking a Meeting
```
User: "help me to book a meeting"
Bot: "I'd be happy to help you book a meeting! Could you please provide your email address?"

User: "my email is john@example.com"
Bot: "Great! I'll help you book a meeting. What type of meeting would you like to schedule?"
```

### Viewing Events
```
User: "show me the scheduled events"
Bot: "I'd be happy to show you your scheduled events! Could you please provide your email address?"

User: "my email is john@example.com"
Bot: "Here are your scheduled events:
- Team Meeting on 2024-01-15T10:00:00Z (Status: confirmed)"
```

## 🔐 Security & Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (provided)
- `CAL_API_KEY`: Your Cal.com API key (configured)
- `CAL_USERNAME`: Your Cal.com username (needs to be set)

### Security Notes
- API keys are stored in `.env` file (not committed to git)
- Environment variables are used for all sensitive data
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Set Your Cal.com Username**: Edit the `.env` file and replace `your_cal_username_here` with your actual Cal.com username

2. **Test the Integration**: Run `python3 test_cal_api.py` to verify Cal.com connectivity

3. **Start the Application**: Run `python3 app.py` and visit http://localhost:8000

4. **Try the Features**: Use the chat interface to:
   - Book meetings
